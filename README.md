# Evil 2048
A fork of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), with a modified tile generating algroithm. Instead of generating random tiles, it calculates the worst possible location for a tile to appear. The idea is to see if there is a sequence of tile generations that makes the game impossible to win :)
